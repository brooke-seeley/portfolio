I graduate in April 2026 and will be beginning work in May as a Technical Solutions Engineer at Epic.\nI have completed various courses in Mathematics and Statistics as I work toward my degree in Applied Statistics & Analytics. I also took a course in Computer Science (learning Python) and am currently completing multiple online industry courses and certifications (SQL, more Python, Tableau, AWS, Microsoft Azure).\nI was the Brigham Young University Statistics Association Secretary for the 2024-2025 school year. I currently serve as a Teaching Assistant for the BYU Statistics Department and as a Grader for the BYU Mathematics Department. I also volunteer with BYU Football in the Recruiting Department. In my classes and as a volunteer, I have completed various projects related to data science and analysis, which can be viewed on this portfolio or on my GitHub (link below).\nThank you for your interest! Please contact me if you would like more information!"
